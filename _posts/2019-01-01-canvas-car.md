## Description
Optimizing flexibility in future mobility

This report is an image-focused review of Project X. We, as part of the Adaptive Mobility squad, were asked the following question: What does the car of the future need? In order to answer this question, we were allowed to discover an unknown area within the spectrum of the future of mobility. We started with informed assumption that mobility will transform dramatically in the coming decades, in which the car might play a less extensive role. It is our view that the car should focus on its main strength in this changing landscape, namely flexibility. The question which arose from here was How can we optimize flexibility in future private mobility? From this question we developed Canvas Car, a solution for a flexible and adaptable interior lay-out of the personal car.
