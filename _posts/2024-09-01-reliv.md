## Description
The transportation system is in a stage of rapid development. As of December 2024, autonomous driving technology has made significant progress worldwide (Atakishiyev et al., 2024). For example, Tesla plans to launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in China and 
Europe in the first quarter of 2025, currently awaiting regulatory approval (Bao, 2022). In China, several cities are actively expanding autonomous driving test areas, such as Hangzhou and Shenzhen. However, for the time being, due to safety and regulatory developments, it is still a long way from autonomous vehicles (hereafter referred to as AVs) completely replacing manually driven vehicles (hereafter referred to as MDVs). Depending on the use of existing AV technology, it is expected that AVs will account for 50% of all traffic by 2040 (Litman, 2017). 
Therefore, in current estimates, AVs and MDVs will coexist in the transportation system for a long time, which is referred to as mixed traffic. As a result, it will be necessary to address various issues in this area, especially regarding human experience. 



There are some related studies in this field. Mahdinia et al. (2021) studied the safety impact of 
AV following MDV behavior on MDV driver behavior in mixed traffic. Ma and Zhang (2024) 
explored the impact of driving style on the perception and decision making of human drivers in 
mixed traffic. It can be found that there are only a few studies on AV passengers. 



The development of autonomous driving technology is completely changing the design of 
vehicle interiors, shifting the focus from traditional driving tasks to non-driving activities (Yang 
et al., 2019). People's trust in AVs is the root cause (Hamburger et al., 2022). This shift has 
given rise to new interior design ideas that prioritize passenger comfort, relaxation, and 
interactivity (Hirz et al., 2021). Relaxation and comfort have become common design pursuits. 
Therefore, the design will explore ways to alleviate discomfort from the perspective of 
passengers without a driver's license in AVs. Consequently, this design aims to explore the 
emotional experience of passengers in AV in mixed traffic situations.
