## Description
This research explores how inter-vehicle communication can enhance manual drivers’ perception automated vehicles (AVs)to calibrate trust during overtaking and lane-changing scenarios in urban traffic. Through a research-through-design approach, the study identifies key factors influencing trust, including predictability, transparency, communication affordance, and safe AV behaviors. The exploratory research revealed manual drivers’ under-trust of AVs and informed the design of a multi-modality human-machine interface (HMI). The HMI integrates visual interface and haptic feedback to deliver AV maneuvers.The design went though iterative evaluations, including a participatory workshop and a Guerilla evaluation during a demo day. Results from the evaluation, which included Likert-scale assessments and interviews, demonstrated significant improvements in trust, comprehensibility, feeling ofsafety, and efficiency with the HMI. This study contributes to the research area of trust calibration in AVs by proposing a inter-vehicle communication interaction. Future work will focus on refining the prototype, testing in real-world environments, and addressing more complex challenges in mixed traffic scenarios.
