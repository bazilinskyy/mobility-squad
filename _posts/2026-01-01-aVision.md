## Description
Cyclists are a type of vulnerable road user (VRU). Research finds that automated vehicles (AVs) are more susceptible to being in an accident when there are a multitude of factors involved, such as at an intersection. Cyclists feel vulnerable interacting with AVs at intersections, even at those where they have priority. Human communication, such as eye contact, confirms the cyclist has been seen by the manually driven vehicle (MDV). As AVs level 4+ have no driver, there is no communication, and cyclists are hesitant and uncomfortable. Through co-creation workshops, user surveys, interviews, and testing, the proposed concept is AVision. This is a new infrastructure system with embedded lights placed at cyclist’s priority intersections. AVs communicate their intentions via the computer, which communicates those to cyclists via lights. When the cyclist is seen, the lights will turn green, and for MDVs, they turn yellow, prompting the user to make eye contact. Through user testing, cyclists felt more comfortable with AVision than without, while not increasing the visual and mental load. This reinforces the validity of this design as a possibility to address future road scenarios.
