## Description
Across Europe, traffic safety and driver-assistance technologies are becoming central to reducing accidents and fatalities. One of the key advancements in this domain is Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA), an in-vehicle system that helps drivers comply with legal speed limits through sensory/aesthetic feedback and, in some cases, through direct intervention.  

ISA has been made mandatory in all new vehicle models sold within the EU since July 2022, following Regulation (EU) 2019/2144, though in effect, since 2024. The regulation aligns with the European Commission’s broader “Vision Zero” strategy, aiming to reduce road fatalities to near zero by 2050.  

ISA identifies the correct speed limit using traffic sign recognition (TSR), digital maps, and GNSS positioning, although only one primary method is legally required, the TSR, with GNSS and maps recommended as complementary sources to improve accuracy. Manufacturers are expected to meet the intent of the policy rather than follow a fixed technical architecture. 

ISA exists in three forms: Open ISA, which issues visual or auditory warnings; Half-Open ISA, which adds resistance to the accelerator pedal; and Closed ISA, which can automatically restrict engine torque. All types allow degrees of driver override. A data-processing hierarchy ensures reliable detection: TSR takes precedence, followed by map data, GNSS, a sensor-fusion ECU, the driver-facing HMI, and, when applicable, electronic throttle control. 

By default, ISA activates on start-up and temporary overriding is allowed. Studies across Europe show that ISA reduces average speeds and speed variability, potentially lowering road fatalities by 20% (European Parliament. (2019, March 26)).  Despite its potential, ISA remains controversial. Many drivers perceive it as intrusive or unreliable and frequently disable it. This user behaviour undermines the system’s safety goals and highlights a critical design challenge.  

Main research question 

How can an Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) interface be designed to increase user compliance and trust, by improving transparency and reducing irritation while maintaining road safety and adhering to regulatory requirements?
