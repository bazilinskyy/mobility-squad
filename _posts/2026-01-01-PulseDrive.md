## Description
Designing an interface that keeps the driver in the loop as well as raises takeover readiness in L2 (semi-automated) vehicles. The main task is to minimize driver distractions and improve driver situation awareness, while limiting fatigue and annoyance. 
Approach: 
From the beginning of the project we wanted to pursue a more conceptual design direction that featured a physical interface. After discussing the original, digitally focused interface brief with our coaches, we received approval to deviate from its initial intent. While the goals and expectations we set for our design evolved with its development, two streams can be outlined. During the initial ideation phase, we discussed exploring different sensory experiences, focusing on experimental materials and haptic interaction rather than conventional graphical user interfaces. While minimizing reliance on electronics to cut down processing times and instead using form and shape changing materials, the primary objective was to alert the driver in the event of a monitoring or takeover request. After revising our approach, the central outlined goal was to keep the driver “in the loop”, by providing continuous tactile feedback through our interface. The project always remained conceptually physical rather than digital, as we believed it invited creative outside the box thinking and 
afforded greater opportunities to expand our competencies as designers.
