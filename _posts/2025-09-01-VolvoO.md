## Description
This project explores the application of vibrotactile feedback to deliver predictive motion cues to occupants of SAE Level 3-4 automated vehicles (AVs), enabling them to anticipate imminent vehicle manoeuvres and reduce automation surprise, as well as potentially mitigating motion sickness in the long term. A custom-built research probe was developed for TNO, featuring a 24-motor haptic seat, external controller, and an adaptable GUI supporting real-time control, pattern editing, and CSV import. Haptics were chosen over visual or auditory cues due to their underuse and reliability during distraction-heavy tasks common in AV contexts. User testing on an 8-motor vibrotactile device indicated that dynamic and repeated cues on a full-length seat maximise interpretability. However, directionality confusion and confidence-accuracy mismatches highlight the need for individual calibration. The final prototype was developed with a focus on ergonomics, motor layout, and signal clarity, and supports future research into distraction-resilient cueing, on-road validation, and real-time vehicle data integration. This work advances the HMI field by demonstrating how predictive haptic feedback can enhance situational awareness, comfort, and trust in AVs
