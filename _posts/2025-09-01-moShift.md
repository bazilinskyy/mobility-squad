short: A Biomimicry-Inspired Omnidirectional eHMI Solution That Facilitates Communication From Automated Vehicles to Other Road Users
---

## Description
Automated vehicles (AVs) without human drivers are increasingly present on roads. This shift introduces new traffic scenarios that can create uncertainty between AVs and other road users (ORUs). These scenarios are ranging from simple interactions like pedestrian crossings to complex situations involving emergency vehicles or 
aggressive behaviours. Typically, a vehicle’s intentions are inferred from its acceleration patterns, but sometimes these patterns do not suffice and thus external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been developed to improve communication. However, the variety of special 
situations calls for a more holistic communication approach. This project focused on identifying such scenarios, researching existing eHMI designs and identifying key design requirements. Through an iterative design process, including co-creation studies and expert 
feedback, a final design inspired by biomimicry was created that aimed to reduce uncertainty between AVs and ORUs effectively and in a novel way. Preliminary results showed the eHMI concept functioned as intended.
