## Description
This research aims to explore how roof light design can enhance 
the in-car experience. It examines current trends in vehicle 
lighting design, and through design and technical analysis of 
different vehicle lighting designs, it uses a combination of 
projection and PDLC glass to provide diverse projection effects 
for different scenarios. By replacing the original lighting with 
projection, it achieves personalisation and atmosphere creation, 
providing users with a completely new experience that is different 
from fixed lighting effects.
