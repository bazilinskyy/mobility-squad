short: Designing external communications between Self-driving Cars and Humans

---

## Description
Self-driving cars introduce a particular challenge, which
has prompted various concepts and design solutions;
communication with other road users, such as pedestrians.
In this study, the design, development and testing of an
external communication system is presented, that aims to
bridge the gap of trust between self-driving cars and other
road users. The design features rotating spherical ‘eye’-like
devices mounted on the car that, combined with colored
light signals (cyan for acknowledgement and purple for
yielding), communicate the vehicle’s intentions. User
testing (N=10) was performed in a controlled VR
environment to evaluate the design, in which participants
were presented with two pedestrian-crossing scenarios: one
in which the car does not feature any external
communications, and one with the proposed design. The
results showed significant improvements in the perceived
feeling of safety with the proposed design, as opposed to a
car without any forms of external communication.
