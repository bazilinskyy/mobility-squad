## Description
This study presents a research-through-design process
exploring the interaction between humans and self-
delivery robots. The goal of this project is to design
a user-friendly autonomous delivery robot that is
easy to use, prioritizes the security of users’ personal
packages, enables simple and secure access to orders,
and ensures a smooth and seamless human–robot
interaction throughout the entire delivery process.
Throughout the design research, all aspects of the
robot were considered from its size and physical form
to user interaction and the mechanism for unlocking
compartments to retrieve deliveries.

CHIP is an early-stage physical prototype that functions
as a proof of concept, demonstrating real-life user
interaction with the delivery robot system. Due to its
1:1 scale and fully functioning mechanisms, including
the interactive screen and the locking and unlocking
system, it provided valuable insights during user testing.
In summary, CHIP became an autonomous package
delivery robot designed with user needs and interaction
at its core. Key characteristics include a friendly form, an
animistic design with subtle personality cues, an easy-
to-understand interface, soft pastel colour tones, and a
private and secure unlocking process. Together, these
elements support a safe, intuitive and pleasant delivery
experience.

This report presents the design process and explains
how each design decision was made. It documents
three design iterations, describing the valuable insights
gained in each phase and how the feedback loops were
closed throughout the process. The entire development
is presented in chronological order, concluding with the
final concept as the main deliverable.
