## Description
This research explores the potential of a custom neural network based vision system to enhance motorcycle safety by predicting
car-to-motorcycle collision risks at urban intersections. It aims to
advance conventional Advanced Rider Assistance Systems (ARAS)
by introducing AI-driven, real-time crash prediction tailored specifically for urban settings. A custom neural network machine vision
model is conceptualized along with metrics to assess its predictive
accuracy and performance, which is able to be directly compared
to motorcyclists’ evaluation of collision risks. This comparative
analysis seeks to highlight discrepancies between AI predictions
and human judgment, offering insights to refine the system for
greater reliability and effectiveness.
Additionally, the study examines user feedback to evaluate and
conceptualize the usability and integration of this AI-enhanced
ARAS system. By combining quantitative performance metrics
with qualitative user insights, this research provides a foundation
for the future implementation of AI-powered ARAS systems in
motorcycles
