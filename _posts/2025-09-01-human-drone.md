## Description
The global last-mile logistics infrastructure is under pressure as delivery volumes are increasing, straining the conventional truck-based last-mile network with congestion, cost, and CO₂ emissions. Autonomous aerial delivery drones are emerging as a scalable alternative: operators such as Wing, Zipline, and Meituan have already completed tens of thousands of commercial flights, showcasing advantages in safety, speed, cost, and reduced emissions across use-cases such as food-delivery, medicine. Analysts project that the drone-delivered goods market is going to expand from 0.25 bn USD in 2024 to 65 bn USD by 2034 (74 % CAGR). Rapid growth is observed in several parts of the world (Africa, the United States, and China), especially where regulations, infrastructure, and demand allow for it. However, progress is uneven. Generally, rural and suburban routes are more common because they offer unobstructed landing zones and more permissive regulation; dense cities, where potential demand is the highest, pose unresolved challenges: limited delivery zones, high dedicated infrastructure cost, higher safety risks, and complex regulations. Public acceptance is a major barrier to the large-scale deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for urban delivery. Empirical studies report that users’ trust—the key factor of acceptance—is reduced by a mix of visual factors (e.g., airframe shape), environmental conditions (e.g., landing-site substrate), and psychological responses such as perceived safety and noise annoyance. Because trust strongly predicts acceptance in the delivery-drone context, any design that ignores these influences risks public rejection. To mitigate these constraints, some operators have targeted public parks. For example, Meituan’s Shenzhen pilot employs purpose-built rooftop kiosks to standardise landings, and Matternet drones make use of fixed pads on hospital grounds. Such infrastructure narrows the problem space but limits scalability and site independence while driving up costs.
