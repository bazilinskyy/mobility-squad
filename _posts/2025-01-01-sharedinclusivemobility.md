## Description
Cities are changing the way how people travel, moving away from private cars and looking for more sustainable and accessible ways to travel. 
Current shared mobility systems don’t work well for everyone, especially wheelchair users. This project explores what a shared modular mobility system could look like if it is designed to be accessible and usable for all, including people with physical impairments, based in Ontginning neighbourhood in Eindhoven.
The goal is to create a concept for a small, shared vehicle that supports more spontaneous travel for wheelchair users. The vehicle 
includes features; a fold-out ramp, a universal wheelchair 
lock, a low-entry floor, and a foldable seat for a companion. 
The design is based on user interviews and expert input.
The result is a shared mobility system that is inclusive without 
complicating use for others. It reduces the need for private cars and 
supports people who currently have few travel options. While the 
project focused on concept development, it points to real 
opportunities for more equal mobility in cities.
