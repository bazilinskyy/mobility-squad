## Description
This study explores methods to enhance trust in delivery drones by improving their communication with people, focusing on visual signals such as light patterns and colours. Through a survey and an observation, we identified strategies to help drones communicate more clearly during critical phases.Initial findings showed that light patterns alone were insufficiently clear. The integration of colours improved communication, particularly with red green and cyan, but uncertainty remained about when drones would initiate movement. Adding movement indicators could help signal this initiation.This study highlights the importance of clear, context-aware signals and identifies future research areas, including inclusivity for colour blindness, adaptation to ambient light, and alternative communication methods such as sound signals or adaptive drone behaviour.
